# JS-Practical-Components

Pricing Calculator
  - A simple Calcutor where use inputs price and number of slices and the calculator outputs the total price. DOM manupilation from within JS was used. A simple function to calculate total. One new thing was the range type of input, that became a slider, I had not used that before and seemed like a valueable tool.

Crazy Buttons
  - The crazy buttons project is a simple DOM manipulation project where three buttons are created to and an animation is activated on hoover. The buttons move in a random direction as to not allow someone to click. New elements that i had not used until now were the client Width and Height, as well as the window inner and outer with and height. 

Coding Playground
  - I have previously used code pen and have a few small projects on their, but for people that do not have access to a pc its an option as it can be accessed on ipad and phone. Ipad with a keyboard works well.

  StopWatch
    - The stopwatch is an on screen stop watch with start stop and reset option. It was the most interesting project as  I had not worked with setIntervals before and it was interesting to it implemented, as before being started I was curious as to how the watch times would be displayed and on going.

  Accordion
    - The accordion is a a text accordion as one normally sees in faq sections. It opens when a question is selected and closes the other dialogs. It was useful to learn the this.parentNode and how this can be used to access selected DOM elements.

Scrolling progress bar
  - a progress bar at the top that fills as the scroll through the page progresses. It was the one I struggled with the most because of a small minor typo. Which did not allow my progress bar to come forward and be seem after some debugging it was figured out and solved.
